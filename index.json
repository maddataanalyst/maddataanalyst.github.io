Its main goal is to provide better shopping suggestions for customers on the e-commerce platform. The system was tested on 2018 Amazon Reviews Dataset, using repeated cross validation and compared with other approaches: collaborative filtering (CF) and deep collaborative filtering (DCF) in terms of mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). DCF and DHCF were proved to be significantly better than the CF. DHCF proved to be better than DCF in terms of MAE and MAPE, it also scored the best on separate test data. The significance of the differences was checked by means of a Friedman test, followed by post-hoc comparisons to control p-value. The experiment shows that DHCF can outperform other approaches considered in the study, with more robust scores","tags":["machine learning","deep learning","recommendation systems"],"title":"Improvement of e-commerce recommendation systems with deep hybrid collaborative filtering with content: A case study","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560506400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560506400,"objectID":"c6f06c0bd8153d3be78643d99dac8256","permalink":"/talk/data_science_summit_2019/","publishdate":"2019-06-14T12:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/data_science_summit_2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Using autoencoder neural networks as recommendation engines","tags":["deep learning","machine learning","recommendation engines"],"title":"Recommendation engines based on autoencoders","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Presentation ","date":1528416000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528416000,"objectID":"b3c23b00a5a0c4a72823ecbd50233d14","permalink":"/talk/data_science_summit_2018/","publishdate":"2018-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/data_science_summit_2018/","section":"talk","summary":"The goal of this presentation and associated paper is to present results of investigation related to use of the Extreme Gradient Boosting XGBoost algorithm as a forecasting tool.

Managing competences of employees is one of the most important areas for modern management science. This paper presents, an innovative algorithm based on natural language processing (NLP) and association analysis for recognition, assignment and evaluation of competences in a knowledge-rich organizations. An algorithm performs keywords extraction from applicant's and employees resumes, which are used later on in a supervised phase. Achieved results - 71% of balanced accuracy in a case study suggest, that a system can recognize important correlations between competences and assigned projects.","tags":["machine learning","decision support"],"title":"Machine learning and artificial intelligence as a decision support systems for human capital management","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Filip WÃ³jcik"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519935433,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519935433,"objectID":"d59f0b066df46317beaeb89b7cf3bbc6","permalink":"/publication/xgboost_turnover/","publishdate":"2018-03-01T21:17:13+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/xgboost_turnover/","section":"publication","summary":"The goal of this paper was to investigate use of the Extreme Gradient Boosting XGBoost algorithm as a forecasting tool.

One of them is classification, understood in this context as assigning objects to categories. Amongst many methods to achieve this goal, rulebased systems pay special attention, because they provide an end-user not only with direct answers to a given problem, but also produce useful insights into correlations present in a dataset. In this article new method has been proposed âˆ’ application and modification of Leo Breimanâ€™s original Random Forest solution combined with backwards elimination (known from classic regression) âˆ’ and tested on real credit decisions dataset. Differences in classification metrics between base and augmented classifier were checked using cross-validation testing, and statistical significance. The article concludes with further research suggestions.","tags":["machine learning","decision support systems"],"title":"Detecting business-relevant attributes in rule-based classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Presentation ","date":1491523200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491523200,"objectID":"a698b852b21aac0dca5b2031f78e44ff","permalink":"/talk/code_forward_2017/","publishdate":"2017-04-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/code_forward_2017/","section":"talk","summary":"H2O AI is one of the most interesting out-of-the-box machine learning tools.
