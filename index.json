The data provided by the Rossman Com-pany, with a request to design an innovative prediction method, has been used as a base for this case study. The data contains details about micro- and macro-environment, as well as turnover of 1115 stores. Performance of the algorithm was compared to classical forecasting models SARIMAX and Holt-Winters, using time-series cross validation and tests for statistical importance in prediction quality dif-ferences. Metrics of root mean squared percentage error (RMSPE), Theilâ€™s coeffi-cient and adjusted correlation coefficient were analyzed. Results where then passed to Rossman for verification on a separate validation set, via Kaggle.com platform. Study results confirmed, that XGBoost, after using proper data preparation and training method, achieves better results than classical models.","tags":null,"title":"XGBoost as a time-series forecasting tool","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Presentation \n","date":1523664000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523664000,"objectID":"b7533be3376bebbe373b7947d06d5b93","permalink":"/talk/scientific_achievments_2018/","publishdate":"2018-04-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/scientific_achievments_2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Human capital and human resources are key success factors for multiple knowledge-based companies. Managing competences of employees is one of the most important areas for modern management science. This paper presents, an innovative algorithm based on natural language processing (NLP) and association analysis for recognition, assignment and evaluation of competences in a knowledge-rich organizations. An algorithm performs keywords extraction from applicant's and employees resumes, which are used later on in a supervised phase. Achieved results - 71% of balanced accuracy in a case study suggest, that a system can recognize important correlations between competences and assigned projects.","tags":null,"title":"Machine learning and artificial intelligence as a decision support systems for human capital management","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Presentation \n","date":1446681600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1446681600,"objectID":"ab885553e108a7fca8f76aa921130da3","permalink":"/talk/code_forward_2016/","publishdate":"2015-11-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/code_forward_2016/","section":"talk","summary":"Machine learning algorithms are replacement for an old-fashioned advisory systems.

Relation of machine learning to Big Data. Application of Machine learning to analyze Big Data Use cases (mostly from business perspective) for machine learning: Classification â€“ customer preferences/automated expert systems construction, Pattern recognition â€“ market basket analysis/discovering preferences/data explanation, Regression â€“ predicting trends, modelling of processes, financial analysis, Clusterization â€“ grouping customers/ finding similarities between customers groups, reducing the voulumes of data. Data used in machine learning: structured data â€“ structured files/SQL data/logs, unstructured data â€“ text, semantic web, data feeds data exploration: examining the relationships between data parts, finding correlated fatures, data transformations â€“ changing domains, adjusting data for the concrete algorithm.
