      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this presentation and associated paper is to present results of investigation related to use of the Extreme Gradient Boosting XGBoost algorithm as a forecasting tool. The data provided by the Rossman Com-pany, with a request to design an innovative prediction method, has been used as a base for this case study. The data contains details about micro- and macro-environment, as well as turnover of 1115 stores. Performance of the algorithm was compared to classical forecasting models SARIMAX and Holt-Winters, using time-series cross validation and tests for statistical importance in prediction quality dif-ferences. Metrics of root mean squared percentage error (RMSPE), Theil’s coeffi-cient and adjusted correlation coefficient were analyzed. Results where then passed to Rossman for verification on a separate validation set, via Kaggle.com platform. Study results confirmed, that XGBoost, after using proper data preparation and training method, achieves better results than classical models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recommendation engines based on autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://maddataanalyst.github.io/en/talk/recommendation-engines-based-on-autoencoders/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recommendation engines are probably the most important tools for modern e-commerce organizations. As the data volumes grow larger and larger (as well as product/user base), traditional approaches based on collaborative might be not enough. During this talk I will present alternative approaches to recommendations - making use of deep stacked autoencoders.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Machine learning and artificial intelligence as a decision support systems for human capital management</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Human capital and human resources are key success factors for multiple knowledge-based companies. Managing competences of employees is one of the most important areas for modern management science. This paper presents, an innovative algorithm based on natural language processing (NLP) and association analysis for recognition, assignment and evaluation of competences in a knowledge-rich organizations. An algorithm performs keywords extraction from applicant’s and employees resumes, which are used later on in a supervised phase. Achieved results - 71% of balanced accuracy in a case study suggest, that a system can recognize important correlations between competences and assigned projects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;H2O AI is one of the most interesting out-of-the-box machine learning tools. It has plenty of algorithms implemented, those algorithms are really fast and effective and it integrates well with R and Spark. One of them is especially interesing - Gradient Boosting. Want to know more?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Filip Wójcik and I’m a data scientist and a programmer with specialization in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Recently I have also become a Ph.D. at the Wroclaw University of Economics, IT in Economics Institute, faculty of Business Intelligence in Management. I’ve also graduated as a lawyer but… well… everybody makes mistakes, so let’s skip this part 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning and matters related with data science are my hobby, professional activity and the most important research area. I believe, that I’ve found (so often discussed) balance between those main life areas. Now I try to share my passion with students and all interested people during conferences and lectures. This website was designed to be a platform to share educational materials and my research papers findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from that – I’m a happy husband, keeper of two lovely kittens and sports fanatic – starting from (so popular now) CrossFit, through martial arts (2nd Dan Aikido, self-defense instructor and Krav Maga prcaticioner) ending up with mountains tourism.&lt;/p&gt;
