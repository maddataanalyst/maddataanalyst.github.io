      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Filip WÃ³jcik and Iâ€™m a data scientist and a programmer with specialization in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Recently I have also become a Ph.D. at the Wroclaw University of Economics, IT in Economics Institute, faculty of Business Intelligence in Management. Iâ€™ve also graduated as a lawyer butâ€¦ wellâ€¦ everybody makes mistakes, so letâ€™s skip this part ðŸ™‚&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning and matters related with data science are my hobby, professional activity and the most important research area. I believe, that Iâ€™ve found (so often discussed) balance between those main life areas. Now I try to share my passion with students and all interested people during conferences and lectures. This website was designed to be a platform to share educational materials and my research papers findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from that â€“ Iâ€™m a happy husband, keeper of two lovely kittens and sports fanatic. In 2023 I became a certified Street Workout and Calisthenics trainer ðŸ¤¸. Additionaly I train modern fencing ðŸ¤º and often go hiking in the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
