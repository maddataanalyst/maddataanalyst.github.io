      <description>Hello!
My name is Filip WÃ³jcik and Iâ€™m a data scientist and a programmer with specialization in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Recently I have also become a Ph.d. student at the Wroclaw University of Economics, IT in Economics Institute, faculty of Business Intelligence in Management. Iâ€™ve also graduated as a lawyer butâ€¦ wellâ€¦ everybody makes mistakes, so letâ€™s skip this part ðŸ™‚
Machine learning and matters related with data science are my hobby, professional activity and the most important research area.</description>
